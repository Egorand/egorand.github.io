Hey, I'm Egor Andreevich, and this is my tech blog where I write about Android, Kotlin and tech in
general.

I work at [Cash App][cash-app] and live in Barcelona, Spain. I'm originally from Chisinau,
Republic of Moldova, and I've been living in Spain since 2022. Outside of work I like to travel,
watch football ⚽️, play guitar and listen to good music.
