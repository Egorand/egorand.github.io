Co-presented with [John Rodriguez][john].

As more and more Android code is being written in Kotlin, and many developers are switching over 
from Java, the performance of the Kotlin compiler has become a hot discussion topic. Javac has been 
tuned and optimized for many years, so how does kotlinc compare?

In addition, there are a whole new family of tools around kotlinc, such as kapt, the Kotin Gradle 
plugin and more. How can one use them efficiently to get optimal performance?

In this talk, weâ€™ll take a deep dive into the following:

* Is Kotlin slower than Java? Should you worry?
* Caching and incrementality of Kotlin compilation
* How to use Kotlin with Gradle efficiently
* What is compilation avoidance and what are the state of things in Kotlin?
* Kotlin compilation in the context of Android

This talk will help you develop a better understanding of how your code is built, what performance 
bottlenecks exist in the toolchain, and how to avoid them to improve your build times.
