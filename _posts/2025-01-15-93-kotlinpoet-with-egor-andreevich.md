Today, we talk about [KotlinPoet][kotlinpoet] with Egor Andreevich. KotlinPoet is a library from 
Square used to **generate** Kotlin code. It’s a great tool to generate code at compile time, and 
it’s used by many libraries and frameworks for Android and not only.

Egor has been involved with KotlinPoet for multiple years and today will share with us how 
KotlinPoet works, when to use it, and how to contribute to the project.
