One of the core properties of automated tests is that they should be **reliable**, meaning that a 
test should either pass or fail, no matter how many times or in what conditions it is being run. 
Tests that tend to sometimes fail with no clear reason are usually called **flaky**, and those are a
real problem. At some point the development team would just give up fixing flaky tests time and time
again and will stop running them at all - and suddenly we've lost that safety net guarding us 
against inevitable regressions. While unit tests should generally not allow any room for flakiness 
by mocking out all dependencies, functional tests are a different story. A classic example would be 
testing a simple screen that loads data from network - it will fail every time you run it while 
offline! So how do we go about writing reliable functional tests, that are not affected by network 
conditions? In this article I'll describe an approach that uses Dagger to create clean and robust 
functional tests.

### So what's Dagger?

[Dagger][dagger] has become a pretty standard tool in many Android developers' arsenals, however, 
for those who haven't heard - it's a fast [dependency injection][di] framework, developed by 
[Square][square], and specifically optimized for Android. Unlike some of the other popular 
dependency injectors, Dagger doesn't use reflection and relies on generated code for speed. We'll 
use Dagger in our app to be able to substitute our dependencies with test doubles in a clean way, 
without breaking encapsulation or writing unnecessary code that will only be used by tests. So let's
get going!

### The Weather app

We'll develop a simple one-screen weather app for demonstration purposes. The app should ask the 
user to provide the name of the city and will download some information about current weather in 
this city. That's how it looks:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![P1h8Y22](/assets/P1h8Y22.png)
{: refdef}

The complete source code is available on [GitHub][github].

### OpenWeatherMap API

We'll use the [OpenWeatherMap API][open-weather-map-api] to access weather data. The API is free, 
however you'll need to sign up for an API key if you want to download the code and compile the app 
on your machine.

### REST API client setup

Let's start with setting up the REST API client that will implement data fetching. We'll be using 
[Retrofit][retrofit] along with [RxJava][rxjava], so the following dependencies go to our 
`build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // rest of dependencies

    compile 'com.squareup.retrofit:retrofit:1.9.0'
    compile 'io.reactivex:rxandroid:1.0.1'
}
```

Next is a simple POJO called `WeatherData` that will represent the information we fetch from the 
server:

```java
public class WeatherData {

    public static final String DATE_FORMAT = "EEEE, d MMM";

    private static final int KELVIN_ZERO = 273;

    private static final String FORMAT_TEMPERATURE_CELSIUS = "%dÂ°";
    private static final String FORMAT_HUMIDITY = "%d%%";

    private String name;
    private Weather[] weather;
    private Main main;

    public String getCityName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getWeatherDate() {
        return new SimpleDateFormat(DATE_FORMAT, Locale.getDefault()).format(new Date());
    }

    public String getWeatherState() {
        return weather().main;
    }

    public String getWeatherDescription() {
        return weather().description;
    }

    public String getTemperatureCelsius() {
        return String.format(FORMAT_TEMPERATURE_CELSIUS, (int) main.temp - KELVIN_ZERO);
    }

    public String getHumidity() {
        return String.format(FORMAT_HUMIDITY, main.humidity);
    }

    private Weather weather() {
        return weather[0];
    }

    private static class Weather {
        private String main;
        private String description;
    }

    private static class Main {
        private float temp;
        private int humidity;
    }
}
```

And then the simple Retrofit interface, containing the description of a GET request we'll be making 
to fetch the data:

```java
public interface WeatherApiClient {

    Endpoint ENDPOINT = Endpoints.newFixedEndpoint("http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5");

    @GET("/weather") Observable<WeatherData> getWeatherForCity(@Query("q") String cityName);
}
```

And that's it so far for the networking setup. Let's now set up Dagger and teach it to provide an 
implementation of `WeatherApiClient` to the classes that will be using it.

### Dagger setup

To add Dagger to your project, add the following lines to `build.gradle`:

```groovy
final DAGGER_VERSION = '2.0.2'

dependencies {
    // Retrofit dependencies are here

    compile "com.google.dagger:dagger:${DAGGER_VERSION}"
    apt "com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:${DAGGER_VERSION}"
    provided 'org.glassfish:javax.annotation:10.0-b28'
}
```

You'll notice `apt` scope used to include the `dagger-compiler` artefact: since `dagger-compiler` is
an annotation processor, we'll only want to use it at compilation stage and not package it into the 
APK (`dagger-compiler` is actually pretty big in terms of dex method count). This can be achieved by
using the [android-apt][android-apt] plugin. Add the following line to your top-level `build.gradle`
file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // other classpath declarations
        classpath 'com.neenbedankt.gradle.plugins:android-apt:1.8'
    }
}
```

And then the following at the top of the app `build.gradle` file, right below the 
`apply plugin: 'com.android.application'`:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.neenbedankt.android-apt'
```

Now we're all set with the dependencies. Let's proceed with creating a Dagger module, which will 
describe our logic of providing dependencies:

```java
@Module
public class AppModule {

    private final Context context;

    public AppModule(Context context) {
        this.context = context.getApplicationContext();
    }

    @Provides @AppScope public Context provideAppContext() {
        return context;
    }

    @Provides public WeatherApiClient provideWeatherApiClient() {
        return new RestAdapter.Builder()
                .setEndpoint(WeatherApiClient.ENDPOINT)
                .setRequestInterceptor(apiKeyRequestInterceptor())
                .setLogLevel(BuildConfig.DEBUG ? RestAdapter.LogLevel.FULL : RestAdapter.LogLevel.NONE)
                .build()
                .create(WeatherApiClient.class);
    }

    private RequestInterceptor apiKeyRequestInterceptor() {
        return new ApiKeyRequestInterceptor(context.getString(R.string.open_weather_api_key));
    }
}
```

As you can see, `provideWeatherApiClient()` is actually creating and returning the instance of 
`WeatherApiClient`: this code will be called by Dagger every time we'll request it to provide us 
with an instance of `WeatherApiClient`. Sweet! Now let's add a `Component` interface, that will 
describe the contract of the dependency graph of our app, created by Dagger:

```java
@AppScope
@Component(modules = AppModule.class)
public interface AppComponent {

    void inject(MainActivity activity);

    @AppScope Context appContext();

    WeatherApiClient weatherApiClient();
}
```

The `AppComponent` is able to provide the instance of the application `Context` and instances of 
`WeatherApiClient`, and it can also inject dependencies into the `MainActivity`.

Finally, we'll need to instantiate our `AppComponent` and make it available to other classes. We'll 
add the following into our custom `Application` class called `WeatherApp`:

```java
public class WeatherApp extends Application {

    private AppComponent appComponent;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        appComponent = DaggerAppComponent.builder()
                .appModule(new AppModule(this))
                .build();
    }

    public AppComponent appComponent() {
        return appComponent;
    }
}
```

Now let's switch to `MainActivity` and see how we can access `WeatherApiClient` and fetch weather 
data.

### MainActivity

The relevant parts of the `MainActivity` are as follows ([complete source][main-activity]):

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements SearchView.OnQueryTextListener {

    @Inject WeatherApiClient weatherApiClient;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        ((WeatherApp) getApplication()).appComponent().inject(this);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onQueryTextSubmit(String query) {
        if (!TextUtils.isEmpty(query)) {
            loadWeatherData(query);
        }
        return true;
    }

    private void loadWeatherData(String cityName) {
        subscription = weatherApiClient.getWeatherForCity(cityName)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .subscribe(
                        // handle result
                        }
                );
    }
}
```

Notice how we instantiate `WeatherApiClient`: instead of doing it manually we're marking it with an 
`@Inject` annotation and doing the following in `onCreate()`:

```java
((WeatherApp) getApplication()).appComponent().inject(this);
```

By accessing our `AppComponent` and requesting it to inject the `MainActivity` we're asking Dagger 
to satisfy all the dependencies, marked with `@Inject`, which it successfully does. Now we can use 
`WeatherApiClient` to fetch the data.

Although this approach looks verbose and anything else but straightforward at first glance, the 
power is in the fact that we don't hardcode the logic of creating dependencies in the code itself. 
This will prove very useful when we'll need to substitute the dependencies in test mode, which is 
our next step.

### Espresso setup

Let's now integrate Espresso into our project and write a test to verify that we can correctly load 
and display weather data. First, add the following to the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
final ESPRESSO_VERSION = '2.2.1'
final ESPRESSO_RUNNER_VERSION = '0.4'

dependencies {
    // 'compile' dependencies

    androidTestCompile "com.android.support.test:runner:${ESPRESSO_RUNNER_VERSION}"
    androidTestCompile "com.android.support.test:rules:${ESPRESSO_RUNNER_VERSION}"
    androidTestCompile "com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:${ESPRESSO_VERSION}"
    androidTestApt "com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:${DAGGER_VERSION}"
}
```

Notice that we also need to mention `dagger-compiler` here, since our test code must also be 
processed by the annotation processor. And then let's add the following test class:

```java
@LargeTest
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
public class MainActivityTest {

    private static final String CITY_NAME = "MÃ¼nchen";

    @Rule public ActivityTestRule<MainActivity> activityTestRule = new ActivityTestRule<>(MainActivity.class);

    @Inject WeatherApiClient weatherApiClient;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        weatherApiClient = ((WeatherApp) activityTestRule.getActivity().getApplication()).appComponent()
                .weatherApiClient();
    }

    @Test
    public void correctWeatherDataDisplayed() {
        WeatherData weatherData = weatherApiClient.getWeatherForCity(CITY_NAME).toBlocking().first();

        onView(withId(R.id.action_search)).perform(click());
        onView(withId(android.support.v7.appcompat.R.id.search_src_text)).perform(replaceText(CITY_NAME));
        onView(withId(android.support.v7.appcompat.R.id.search_src_text)).perform(pressKey(KeyEvent.KEYCODE_ENTER));

        onView(withId(R.id.city_name)).check(matches(withText(weatherData.getCityName())));
        onView(withId(R.id.weather_date)).check(matches(withText(weatherData.getWeatherDate())));
        onView(withId(R.id.weather_state)).check(matches(withText(weatherData.getWeatherState())));
        onView(withId(R.id.weather_description)).check(matches(withText(weatherData.getWeatherDescription())));
        onView(withId(R.id.temperature)).check(matches(withText(weatherData.getTemperatureCelsius())));
        onView(withId(R.id.humidity)).check(matches(withText(weatherData.getHumidity())));
    }
}
```

The test case is pretty straightforward: we want to load the data for a certain city and verify that
it's displayed correctly. It should work fine in most cases, but imagine running it on a device in 
Airplane mode - it will most definitely fail! Since our test case is designed to verify that the app
displays the data correctly, lack of data due to inability to connect to the network is not a valid 
scenario to make the test case fail. In addition, we'll probably want to write another test case 
that checks that our app behaves well in Airplane mode, showing a meaningful error to the user, - 
how do we make both test cases pass at the same time? Dagger to the rescue! Let's leverage the power
of dependency injection and provide an implementation of `WeatherApiClient` that we could configure 
with data that we expect to receive.

### MockWeatherApiClient

A solution we're looking for is a `WeatherApiClient` that just returns hardcoded data. Let's create 
a `TestData` class that will store a JSON representation of the response we're expecting to receive:

```java
public final class TestData {

    public static final String MUNICH_WEATHER_DATA_JSON = "\n" +
            "{\n" +
            "    \"coord\": {\n" +
            "        \"lon\": 11.58,\n" +
            "        \"lat\": 48.14\n" +
            "    },\n" +
            "    \"weather\": [{\n" +
            "        \"id\": 741,\n" +
            "        \"main\": \"Fog\",\n" +
            "        \"description\": \"fog\",\n" +
            "        \"icon\": \"50n\"\n" +
            "    }],\n" +
            "    \"base\": \"cmc stations\",\n" +
            "    \"main\": {\n" +
            "        \"temp\": 275.68,\n" +
            "        \"pressure\": 1030,\n" +
            "        \"humidity\": 93,\n" +
            "        \"temp_min\": 274.15,\n" +
            "        \"temp_max\": 277.15\n" +
            "    },\n" +
            "    \"wind\": {\n" +
            "        \"speed\": 1.5,\n" +
            "        \"deg\": 240\n" +
            "    },\n" +
            "    \"clouds\": {\n" +
            "        \"all\": 0\n" +
            "    },\n" +
            "    \"dt\": 1449350400,\n" +
            "    \"sys\": {\n" +
            "        \"type\": 1,\n" +
            "        \"id\": 4887,\n" +
            "        \"message\": 0.0134,\n" +
            "        \"country\": \"DE\",\n" +
            "        \"sunrise\": 1449298092,\n" +
            "        \"sunset\": 1449328836\n" +
            "    },\n" +
            "    \"id\": 6940463,\n" +
            "    \"name\": \"Altstadt\",\n" +
            "    \"cod\": 200\n" +
            "}";

    private TestData() {
        // no instances
    }
}
```

The `MockWeatherApiClient` will just parse the JSON and return the data. We'll also add some delay 
to emulate network latency:

```java
public class MockWeatherApiClient implements WeatherApiClient {

    @Override public Observable<WeatherData> getWeatherForCity(String cityName) {
        WeatherData weatherData = new Gson().fromJson(TestData.MUNICH_WEATHER_DATA_JSON, WeatherData.class);
        return Observable.just(weatherData).delay(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    }
}
```

By having a configurable `WeatherApiClient` we no longer depend on any external conditions, we can 
configure the client to return any data we want to test against. Let's now figure out how to make 
our test work with `MockWeatherApiClient`, rather than the real client that our app is using.

### Dagger test setup

We'll need to mirror the setup we've already performed in our app code, so let's start with creating
the `TestAppModule`:

```java
@Module
public class TestAppModule {

    private final Context context;

    public TestAppModule(Context context) {
        this.context = context.getApplicationContext();
    }

    @Provides @AppScope public Context provideAppContext() {
        return context;
    }

    @Provides public WeatherApiClient provideWeatherApiClient() {
        return new MockWeatherApiClient();
    }
}
```

This class looks pretty much like `AppModule`, but instead of creating the real `WeatherApiClient` 
implementation through Retrofit, it simply instantiates our `MockWeatherApiClient`. Let's now add 
the `TestAppComponent`:

```java
@AppScope
@Component(modules = TestAppModule.class)
public interface TestAppComponent extends AppComponent {

    void inject(MainActivityTest test);
}
```

`TestAppComponent` extends `AppComponent` and adds an `inject()` method that our test class will 
use. Let's change the `setUp()` method in the test class to the following:

```java
@Before
public void setUp() {
    ((TestWeatherApp) activityTestRule.getActivity().getApplication()).appComponent().inject(this);
}
```

The last thing is to substitute the `WeatherApp` with a test double:

```java
public class TestWeatherApp extends WeatherApp {

    private TestAppComponent testAppComponent;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        testAppComponent = DaggerTestAppComponent.builder()
                .testAppModule(new TestAppModule(this))
                .build();
    }

    @Override
    public TestAppComponent appComponent() {
        return testAppComponent;
    }
}
```

Notice that we're now returning a `TestAppComponent` instead of the `AppComponent`. The interface of
the class remains the same, meaning that the app code will have no idea it's working against a test 
double.

We're all done with the Dagger setup, but a crucial piece is missing: how do we make our tests use 
`TestWeatherApp` instead of `WeatherApp`? The answer is - by using a custom test runner!

### Implementing a custom test runner

The `AndroidJUnitRunner` used to run Espresso tests has a convenient method called 
`newApplication()`, that we can override to substitute `WeatherApp` with `TestWeatherApp`:

```java
public class WeatherTestRunner extends AndroidJUnitRunner {

    @Override
    public Application newApplication(ClassLoader cl, String className, Context context) throws InstantiationException,
            IllegalAccessException, ClassNotFoundException {
        String testApplicationClassName = TestWeatherApp.class.getCanonicalName();
        return super.newApplication(cl, testApplicationClassName, context);
    }
}
```

Also don't forget to declare the new test runner in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
    // rest of configuration

    testInstrumentationRunner "me.egorand.weather.runner.WeatherTestRunner"
}
```

And that's it! We can run the tests with the following command:

```
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

We now have a setup that will allow us to run our functional tests independent of the network 
condition and be sure that they'll pass! Check the complete source code for this article on 
[GitHub][github].

### Conclusion

As I've mentioned in [Testing a sorted list with Espresso][testing-a-sorted-list-with-espresso], 
having a suite of acceptance tests is a great way to catch regressions and make sure most bugs are 
caught by your development team, not by your users. It's important to make sure your tests are 
reliable: flaky tests just waste your team's time on fixing them again and again, until everyone 
decides to stop running them at all.

By using Dagger we can decouple the logic of dependency injection from our code, which allows us to 
use test doubles and control some of the aspects of our application under test. This article 
describes using such technique to allow running network-related tests in offline mode and making 
sure they pass. It's worth mentioning though, that this approach can't be used if your tests are 
designed as end-to-end tests, since we're not testing the app in real conditions, just like your 
users will. Still, it's a perfectly valid approach for functional tests, and gives you a lot of 
flexibility in testing different aspects of your application logic.
