Co-presented with [Jesse Wilson][jesse].

We sit down with Jesse and Egor from CashApp (Square) to discuss how they decided to port OKio and 
OKHttp completely to Kotlin Multiplatform back when Kotlin wasn't even officially supported by 
Google. We discuss their ventures, reactions from the community, as well as some other things 
they're using Kotlin for on the backend.
