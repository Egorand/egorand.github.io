There's plenty of ways to design an Android application, most of them are correct and some of them 
scale well. The Cash Android app is growing in size and complexity, which constantly prompts us to 
re-evaluate our design decisions. This talk will provide a thorough overview of the state of our 
app's architecture, the challenges we're facing and how we're planning to address them. The topics 
will include:

* Modularization
* Build tooling
* Navigation
* RxJava
* Testing
* and more

Square is widely known for building great open source software, and this talk will go over our open 
source stack and ways in which your project can benefit from the tools we built!
